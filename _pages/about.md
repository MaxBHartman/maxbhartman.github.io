Hi, I'm Max Hartman, an MS student at the [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/) department, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Minh N. Do](https://minhdo.ece.illinois.edu/). Previously, I completed my BS at UIUC in Computer Engineering, advised by [Prof. Lav R. Varshney](https://www.varshney.csl.illinois.edu/). 

My research is focused in AI Safety, Interpretability, and Information Theory. My main goals are to invent techniques to better understand *how* and *why* models make decisions, and build Federated systems so AI techniques can be safetly applied to fields with sensitive data (e.g. Healthcare) or in industries where competitors cannot share raw data but can mutually benefit from a shared global model (e.g. manufacturing).
