Hi, I'm Max Hartman, an MS student at the [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/) department, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Minh N. Do](https://minhdo.ece.illinois.edu/). Previously, I completed my BS at UIUC in Computer Engineering, advised by [Prof. Lav R. Varshney](https://www.varshney.csl.illinois.edu/).

My research is centered around how information is stored and processed in large models (currently focused on VLMs). I am particularly interested in what in how information across modalities is used. I enjoy theoretically explaining why certain mechanisms occur in models and using such insights to improve model performance, reasoning, and efficiency with archtectural and inference-time modifications.

Additionally, I have been working on building Federated systems so AI techniques can be safetly applied to fields with sensitive data (e.g. Healthcare) or in industries where competitors cannot share raw data but can mutually benefit from a shared global model (e.g. manufacturing).
